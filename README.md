# Operating-System

Our aim is to give you an adequate knowledge about:

the bases of operating systems
  the notions, the tasks, the planning goals, the usage categories, the application interface and the base of system calls
  
  the notions of processes, process description, process tables and their implementation, threads and their implementation, the main differences between threads and processes
  
  the bases of processes, scheduling and the main scheduling algorithms 
  
  the bases of parallelism, cooperative processes, competitive situations, critical sections, semaphors, monitors, deadlock and their features
  
  the methods of memory management, the notion of virtual memory, its implementations, the base algorithms of virtual memory handling
  
  input/output scheduling algorithms, the services of file systems, their implementations

the base usage possibilities of operating systems (Linux, Windows)

  the usage of command line and graphical interfaces of operating systems
  
  the knowledge of handling system directories, the base file system calls
  
  the usage of process handling calls (fork, execv, kill etc.)
  
  the ability to protect the critical sections of parallel processes with semafor usage
  
  the usage of shared memory and base network possibilities (socket)

the base ability of writing system closed programs:

  the usage of C, C++ compiler (GNU, cc, gcc)
  
  the knowledge of filesystem manipulating system calls
  
  the usage of process handling system calls (fork, kill, execv â€¦)
  
  the usage of base message sending system calls
  
  the ability of writing programs which handle shared memory, pipe and sockets.
